        <h2>Here's a timeline of Cristiano Ronaldo's career</h2>
        <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li><b>2001 - 2003</b>: At the age of 16, Cristiano Ronaldo made a nervous debut for Sporting CP, making 25
                appearances and scoring 3 goals between 2001 and 2003.</li>
            <li><b>2003</b>: After impressing with his skills in a friendly match against Manchester United, Cristiano
                Ronaldo joined the club for £12.24 million, as recommended by players and Sir Alex Ferguson himself.
            </li>
            <li><b>2008</b>: Ronaldo's remarkable season at Manchester United saw him score 42 goals, earning him the
                Golden Boot award for Europe's top goalscorer, and winning the Ballon d'Or, making him the first United
                player since George Best in 1968 to achieve this feat. His standout performance in the Champions League
                final against Chelsea further solidified his status as one of the best players in the world.</li>
            <li><b>2009</b>: Ronaldo, after feeling he had accomplished everything at Manchester United, made a
                high-profile transfer to Real Madrid for a record-breaking fee of £80 million, where he was welcomed by
                80,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, marking the beginning of his journey with the Spanish
                club.</li>
            <li><b>2011</b>: Despite a disappointing World Cup in 2010, Ronaldo maintained his exceptional form at Real
                Madrid, earning the La Liga Golden Shoe award for scoring the most goals in the season. He demonstrated
                his charitable side by donating the Golden Boots to support children in Gaza, Palestine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="quote">“On the one hand, they are unfair to a football player who millions of fans around the world, Real
            Madrid or no, they are proud. This is without doubt one of the best players of all time.” Florentino Perez
